# Dockerized E-commerce Application with Jenkins CI/CD

## PURPOSE
This project implements a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Django and React-based e-commerce application using Jenkins, with automated infrastructure provisioning through Terraform. The system automates the build, test, and deployment processes while maintaining security best practices through proper network segregation and access controls.

## STEPS

### 1. Jenkins Infrastructure Setup
- Created a Jenkins controller-node architecture for distributed builds
- Automated Jenkins configuration using Configuration as Code (JCasC)
- Configured necessary plugins and credentials for GitHub, DockerHub, and AWS
- Set up build node with required dependencies (Docker, Terraform)

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- Implemented multibranch pipeline to handle PR merges
- Configured Docker image building for both frontend and backend
- Automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform
- Set up secure credential management in Jenkins

### 3. Infrastructure Provisioning
- Created VPC with public/private subnet architecture
- Implemented security groups for proper access control
- Set up RDS instance in private subnet for database
- Configured load balancer for high availability

### 4. Security Implementation
- Bastion host for secure access to private instances
- NAT Gateway for private subnet internet access
- Proper security group configurations
- Secure credential management through Jenkins

## SYSTEM DESIGN

[System design is shown in the Diagram.jpg included in repository]

Key Components:
1. Jenkins Infrastructure:
   - Controller in public subnet (port 8080)
   - Build node in private subnet
   - Automated configuration using JCasC

2. Application Infrastructure:
   - Frontend/Backend containers in private subnet
   - RDS in private subnet
   - ALB in public subnet
   - Bastion host for secure access

## ISSUES/TROUBLESHOOTING

1. Jenkins Node Connection
   - Issue: Jenkins node needs proper directory setup
   - Solution: Created /home/ubuntu/jenkins directory with correct permissions

2. Docker Permissions
   - Issue: Jenkins user needs docker access
   - Solution: Added jenkins user to docker group and configured sudo access

3. Terraform State Management
   - Issue: Concurrent pipeline runs can conflict
   - Solution: Implemented state locking with S3 backend

4. User Data Execution
   - Issue: Occasional failure of user data script
   - Solution: Added manual execution instructions via bastion host

## OPTIMIZATION

1. Infrastructure Improvements:
   - Implement auto-scaling for application EC2 instances
   - Add CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
   - Implement ECS/EKS for better container orchestration

2. Pipeline Enhancements:
   - Add automated testing stages
   - Implement blue-green deployments
   - Add artifact caching for faster builds

3. Security Enhancements:
   - Implement AWS WAF for ALB
   - Add VPC flow logs for network monitoring
   - Implement HashiCorp Vault for secret management

4. Cost Optimization:
   - Use spot instances for build nodes
   - Implement auto-shutdown for dev environments
   - Optimize RDS instance sizing

## CONCLUSION
This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a containerized application with infrastructure as code. The implementation prioritizes security, automation, and maintainability while providing a scalable foundation for future enhancements. The use of Jenkins Configuration as Code and Terraform enables repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure deployment.

Key achievements:
- Fully automated deployment pipeline
- Secure infrastructure design
- Scalable architecture
- Maintainable configuration as code

Future work should focus on implementing the suggested optimizations to enhance security, performance, and cost-effectiveness of the system.
